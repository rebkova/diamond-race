# diamond-race

A game with racing diamonds. :diamonds: Moving diamonds on the click and keeping score of each.


## :brain: Learning objectives
- how to write classes in vanilla JavaScript
- how to use modules in vanilla JavaScript
- how to use web components

## :thought_balloon: Thought & Execution process
- created clickable diamonds mimicking a predefined styling in a single .js file
- defined onclick function for every diamond - diamonds contributed to mutual score
- moved every diamond to their own .js file - every diamond keeps their own score
- since too much code was repetitive, I've created a class Diamond
- by creating new instances of a pre-defined class I decreased the amount of redundant code
- made the onclick() function work on a singke diamond using class

## :heavy_check_mark: Features
- on click, every diamond moves to the right
- score is being kept for each diamond

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Future improvements
